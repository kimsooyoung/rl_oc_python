# Analytic Estimation of Region of Attraction of an LQR Controller for Torque Limited Simple Pendulum

This repository contains the Code used in the work on ["Analytic Estimation of Region of Attraction of an LQR Controller for Torque Limited Simple Pendulum"](https://dfki-ric-underactuated-lab.github.io/analytic_roa_lqr_pendulum/) of Gross et al.

### Installation

To run and experiment with the code, first you need to follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/dfki-ric-underactuated-lab/torque_limited_simple_pendulum/blob/master/docs/reference/text/chapters/00.installation_guide/01.installation.rst).

For the plots, the python package SciencePlots is needed. It can be installed via:
```
pip install scienceplots
```

### Usage

In the folder [notebooks](notebooks) you can find a jupyter notebook called [sim_data_generate](notebooks/sim_data_generate.ipynb) that runs the simulation used to collect numerical data. [analysis_and_plotting](notebooks/analysis_and_plotting.ipynb) does the region of attraction analysis on the data and generates plots, comparing the analytic approach to the sampling based approach. [analytic_roa](analytic_roa.py) contains the code, which implements the oracle-style function using the analytic approach, [najafi_oracle](najafi_oracle.py) implements the sampling-based version. For a more detailed description of the theory, refer to the technical paper.
